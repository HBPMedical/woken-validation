# Woken validation

Benchmarking (model scoring) and cross-validation support add-on module for Woken.

This software requires [Woken](https://github.com/LREN-CHUV/woken) to work, as it establishes an Akka cluster with Woken as the master.

It embeds [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) which provides the numerical methods for benchmarking and model scoring.

## Usage

```sh

 docker run --rm --env [list of environment variables] --link woken hbpmip/woken-validation:2.5.8

```

where the environment variables are:

* CLUSTER_IP: Name of this server advertised in the Akka cluster
* CLUSTER_PORT: Port of this server advertised in the Akka cluster
* CLUSTER_NAME: Name of Woken cluster, default to 'woken'
* WOKEN_PORT_8088_TCP_ADDR: Address of Woken master server
* WOKEN_PORT_8088_TCP_PORT: Port of Woken master server, default to 8088
* LOG_LEVEL: Level for logs on standard output, default to WARNING
* UDP_ARTERY: if set to true, enables UDP and Akka Artery for communication (experimental, not working yet)

## How to build

Prerequisites: docker, captain

1. Run the build script

```sh
./build.sh
```
It will build the scala project into a Docker container.

## Release

You need the following software installed:

* [Bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion)
* [Precommit](http://pre-commit.com/)

Execute the following commands to distribute Woken as a Docker container:
