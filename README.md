# Woken validation

Benchmarking (model scoring) and cross-validation support add-on module for Woken.

This software requires [Woken](https://github.com/HBPMedical/woken) to work, as it establishes an Akka cluster with Woken as the master.

It embeds [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) which provides the numerical methods for benchmarking and model scoring.

## Usage

```sh

 docker run --rm --env [list of environment variables] --link woken hbpmip/voken-validation:2.1.3

```

where the environment variables are:

* CLUSTER_IP: Name of this server advertised in the Akka cluster
* CLUSTER_PORT: Port of this server advertised in the Akka cluster
* WOKEN_PORT_8088_TCP_ADDR: Address of Woken master server
* WOKEN_PORT_8088_TCP_PORT: Port of Woken master server
* LOG_LEVEL: Level for logs, default to DEBUG
* SDTOUT_LOG_LEVEL: Level for logs on standard output, default to WARNING
* AKKA_TRACING: if set to true, enables Akka tracing (experimental, not working yet)
* UDP_ARTERY: if set to true, enables UDP and Akka Artery for communication (experimental, not working yet)

## How to build

Prerequisites: docker, captain

1. Run the build script

```sh
./build.sh
```
It will build the scala project into a Docker container.

## Release
